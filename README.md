## Bayesian Model Selection, the Marginal Likelihood, and Generalization

This code is an experiment we conducted to compare the Marginal Likelihood and the Conditional Marginal Likelihood applied to Gaussian Processes.
The objective is to analyze how CML optimization improves generalization by ignoring the initial observations in cases where they are noisy.
